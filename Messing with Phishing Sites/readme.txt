How to use the script.
----------------------
(This script is made for chrome browser)

This script is originally made for messing with phising sites to confuse the
site users with fake credentials. Script is tested in a windows environment.

NOTE :- This script is developed to work for my needs, so you must modify the
script to work as you needed.

I recommand you read the documentation of selenium web driver module on

https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/

as for other important stuff:

If you want to get a xpath of a element in a website just use "inspect
elements" option on your web browser and right click on the element you need to
collect the xpath of and you can see a option called "copy" from there you can
copy the xpath of that element accurately.

most of the stuff in this script was gathered from reading documentations and
articles in the internet.

NOTE :- The encoding method I used (ISO-****-*) for reading the files was for my username
and passwords files you can use any method of encoding (UTF-8,ASCI, etc...) that works for you.
